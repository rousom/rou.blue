Yes, that’s a big claim. But have you ever thought about how vegetables were stored before the 1920s, when refrigerators became finally accessible?

Inspired by the art and research project “[Save food from the fridge](http://www.savefoodfromthefridge.com/)”, Wobble aims to do just that: Storing fruits without refrigeration but on a scale that meets the requirements of an actual household. Built modularly, Wobble can easily be configured to match every household’s needs.

Wobble takes into account all the needs of every veggie: Light-sensitivity, humidity, temperature, and exposure to the ripening gas ethylene. The default configuration features two drawers to block light – suitable for vegetables like potatoes or onions. On top of the drawers are four more open shelves for light-loving fruits. By having multiple levels, fruits can be separated depending on their ripening gas sensitivity. One level comes with an up-water tub to increase the humidity for Mediterranean vegetables.

The shelf is extensible with wet-sand pots for storing root vegetables, vases to keep fresh herbs in water, and hooks for hanging bananas.

A small accompanying fold-out brochure explains where each fruit is stored best.
