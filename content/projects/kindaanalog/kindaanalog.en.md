The camera takes multiple strip photos every second which get arranged next to each other on a TV for preview. By moving the camera steadily with the right speed a decently clear image is developed.

Depending on camera-object distance, movement direction, and speed the image gets spatially distorted. As an image needs some time to get created slit by slit, it can also be experimented with temporally.

An additional display mounted to the robot arm presents the user with a menu to choose operating modes from. By selecting one of the three modes the user is guided through the mode by the display. The three modes allow for:
* Portrait: The camera moves vertically, scanning the person in front. 
* Panorama: The robot pans the camera horizontally, capturing wider views or multiple subjects.
* Manual: Using the controller, users can freely control the robot to meet their experimental needs.
