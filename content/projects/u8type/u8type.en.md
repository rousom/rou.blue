All the signs were photographically captured and can be observed in close detail while riding from the end stops – Herrmannstraße to Wittenau – and passing 22 more stations. On the journey from south to north Berlin, a few more background information about the stations’ history can be explored.

While designing the web interface, we wanted to provoke the feeling of actually traveling through the line. Therefore, an animation transitioning between each station is played. The transition evokes the feeling of riding the subway and looking at the signs through the train's window.

To increase the immersion of riding a train – and to add a fun factor – we also built the “Fahrstand.” It comes in a compact box with a short manual for assembly and installation..
