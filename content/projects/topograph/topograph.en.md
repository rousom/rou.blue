By swiping up on the ramp, resonance gets increased. By touching inside the hollow part of the curved pad, a hall effect is applied. Watch the showcase to see how it works:

While designing Topograph, we questioned users about different shapes and what sound or sound changes they would expect. From these insights, we narrowed down which forms are most promising regarding both pleasing sound effects and intuitive understanding.

Based on this research, we combined all shapes and forms in one sculpture. The skeleton of the sculpture is 3D-printed and fitted with copper-foiled touch pads for sensing. The pads are wrapped in a vacuum-formed plastic layer for texture and protection.

The touchpads are connected to a Teensy microcontroller for sensing touch input and audio processing.
